# What is DevOps

* DevOps represents a group of concepts that have catalyzed into a movement and are rapidly spreading throughout the technical community.
* DevOps is considered to be a collaboration between development teams and operations teams throughout the stages of the development lifecycle when creating and operating a service.
* Devops can be seen as the bridge that links development to operations.

### 3 Primary Practice Areas of DevOps

	- **Infrastructure Automation** = When you create your systems, OS configures and app deployments as code.
	- **Continuous Delivery** = When you build, test and deploy
	- **Site Reliability Engineering** = When you Operate your systems; monitoring, orchestration and also when designing for operability in the first place.

## Why DevOps - benefits to the business

### Technical Benefits:
* Continuous Delivery
* Faster resolution to problems
* Transparent and Agile way of working

### Cultural Benefits:
* Better communication between devs and ops
* Greateer professional development opportunities (less focused on specialisation)

### Business Benefits:
* Faster delivery of features
* More stable and sustainable operating environments
* Improved communication
* More time to innovate, rather than maintain, due to automated checks ensuring issues arent brought forward to the client.


## Tools of Devops

Here are some of the most popular devops tools:

1. **Gradle**

This is considered to be a build tool. Apache Ant and Maven dominated the automated build tools for many years. However, from 2009, it gained more popularity and has steadily grown since then. Gradle allows you to write code in Java, C++, Python and many more languages. It is supported by a number of popular IDEs. One of the most notable things about Gradle is the fact that it has incremental builds as they save a reasonable amount of compile time. Gradle allows faster shipping and comes with a lot of configuration possibilities.

2. **Git**

Git is one of the most popular tools in DevOps and is widely used amoung the software industry. It is a Source Code Management tool (SCM) that is very useful for remote teams and open source contributors. Git allows you to track the progress of your development work. You can save different versions of your source code and return to a previous version when neccessary. You can also create separate branches and merge new features when they are ready to go. You can integrate Git with your DevOps workflow by hosting repositories where your team members can push their work.

3. Jenkins

Jenkins is the go-to DevOps automation tool for many software development teams. It is an open source CI/CD server that allows you to automate the different stages in your delivery pipeline. The mian reason for it's popularity is its huge plugin ecosystem meaning it can integrate with almost all DevOps tools, from Docker to Puppet. With Jenkins, you can set up and customize your CI/CD pipeline according to your own needs.

With Jenkins, you vcan iterate and deploy new code as quickly as possible. It also allows you to measure the success of each step of your pipeline.
